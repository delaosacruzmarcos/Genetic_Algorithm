# Genetic_Algorithm
Genetic algorithm is a simple implementation of Artificial Intelligence. The Algorithm uses recursion and random number generation to approach a value. To understand the Algorithm you must be familiar with a few terms. 

 - **Genes** ~ Doubles representing some value. There can be multiple genes in a given animal.
 
 - **Animal** ~ A class that holds a set amount of genes. The animals in a population can cross breed to produce the next population.
 - **Population** ~ A group of animals, they are time dependent on the generation they are in
 - **Generation** ~ The population as a whole, the previous generation dictates the next. 

**Disclaimer I did not write all the code in this repository!**

## Cost Functions
The Algorithm has three different cost functions that can be run. One guesses a single double. Another approximates a line of best fit. The third is the aim bot for the towers minigame. It is important to note that I did not code the gui for the towers game. However it utilizes the code I wrote to react to the players movements.
## Acknowledgment section
I made this project as part of UB’s CSE 116 curriculum. I utilized office hours and course notes to create the code I wrote. I am only posting this thanks to Dr. Hartloff leniency towards past students. Any other code not explicitly stated was written by him and the CSE 116 staff as part of the handout. That being said, I have a good understanding of how the code they wrote works. Since it’s comprehension was necessary for completion of the assignment.

## I endorse test driven development
Please feel free to take a look at my unit testing. I believe that test driven development is a critical part of software engineering. Therefore I write test cases for all of my functions. I found that this is helpful for incremental development. It’s a critical part of the way I develop code.

## Author's note
I coded this project rather early on in my software development career. Therefore my choice of data structures and algorithms may not have been the most efficient. I have since improved my development skills. I may periodically revise this project to update it with more efficient algorithms and structures.
